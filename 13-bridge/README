Bridge

Bridge is used when we need to decouple an abstraction from its
implementation so that the two can vary independently.

This pattern involves an interface which acts as a bridge which
makes  the  functionality  of concrete classes independent from
interface  implementer  classes. Both  types  of classes can be
altered structurally without affecting each other.

IMPLEMENTATION

Interface:

1. DrawAPI

Abstract class using interface DrawAPI:

1. Shape

Concrete class extending Shape.

1. Shape::Circle

Concrete bridge classes implementing DrawAPI.

1. Shape::Circle::Red
2. Shape::Circle::Green
