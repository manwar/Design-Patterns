Abstract Factory

Abstract Factory patterns  work around a super-factory  which creates
other factories. This factory is also called as factory of factories.
This type of design pattern  comes  under  creational pattern as this
pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

In Abstract Factory  pattern an interface is responsible for creating
a factory  of  related  objects  without  explicitly specifying their
classes.  Each  generated  factory  can  give  the objects as per the
Factory pattern.

IMPLEMENTATION

Interface:

Shape

Concrete class implementing interface Shape:

Shape::Square
Shape::RoundedSquare
Shape::Rectangle
Shape::RoundedRectangle

Abstract class:

AbstractFactory

Concrete class extending AbstractFactory:

AbstractFactory::ShapeFactory extends AbstractFactory
AbstractFactory::RoundedShapeFactory extends AbstractFactory

In the end factory generator FactoryProducer::getFactory().
